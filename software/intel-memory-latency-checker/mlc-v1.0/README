Intel(R) Memory Latency Checker- README

This tool measures memory latencies on Linux-based platforms. The tool has the following requirements:
(1) Following libraries need to be present for dynamic linking: GNU C Library (glibc/lpthread) and libnuma library
(2) MSR driver should be loaded. This can typically be done with 'modprobe msr', if it is not already included.
(3) root priviledges are required
